# Hey, I’m Alasdair

I like programming games and making frameworks. Most of my projects are small, but I enjoy figuring out how everything fits together and building my own systems from scratch.  

Right now, I’m mainly working on small games and frameworks to learn more about how engines and tools are built.  

---

### What I’m up to
- Experimenting with **Godot**, **MonoGame**, and **Raylib** to learn different ways of making games.  
- Running my website: **[adderscript.net](https://adderscript.net)**  
- Occasionally breaking things on Linux for fun.

### Stuff I use
**Languages:** TypeScript, C#, C++, Lua, Swift
**Engines & Frameworks:** Kaplay, Godot, MonoGame, Raylib, Love2D  
**Tools:** Neovim (LazyVim), Git, Omarchy, SteamOS

---

### Goals
I’d love to work in **game development** one day, or in **software programming** if not — either way, I’ll always keep making games as a hobby.  

---

### Other stuff
I’ve got a frog called **Syntax the Green** who supervises my code (usually by sleeping next to it).  
When I’m away from my PC, I still code and game on my **Steam Deck**. Sometimes I'll also stream it on twitch at [adderscript](https://m.twitch.tv/adderscript/home)
